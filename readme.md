## Resources

I decided to do changes to the course's project and add more content and interesting things, I found some links and things, that I wanted to share:

- This is the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/745rXlzs53wABj0u5LvZ4v/Sick-fits?node-id=0%3A1) design I did to improve the UI and UX (I'm not a designer, I'm a mortal and simple developer that love design and creative things).

## Getting Help

- **Start backend project**: Go to _backend_ folder and run in your terminal `npm run dev`, go to your favorite browser and put `localhost:3000`. Note: You have to configure `.env` file before running the project. This is the structure of this file:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=omg
CLOUDINARY_KEY=lol
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=yarite
COOKIE_SECRET="PLEASE CHANGE ME OH PLEASE CHANGE ME"
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/sick-fits-keystone
STRIPE_SECRET="sk_test_nahhhh"
MAIL_HOST="smtp.ethereal.email"
